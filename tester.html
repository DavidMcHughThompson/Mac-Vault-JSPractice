    <!--I put the script function above the button bc it wasn't working properly before, and I assumed the function had to be defined before it was called.  In retrospect, it probably wasn't working cause I was using the vscode page, not a browser page.-->

      function playRev2() {
        alert(
          `You have recieved this message because you have been chosen to open an important vault.  Here is the secret combination: ${numOne} - ${numTwo} - ${numThree}`
        );
      }
    </script>
    <!--since the function "playRev2" has no variables and only exists to trigger an alert, it probably could've been in whatever order, but since it has to be defined before it's called in JS, I think it's a decent principle to stick with.-->
